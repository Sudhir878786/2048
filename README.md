# 2048

## About This Project
I'm sure you're familiar with the popluar and addictive game 2048! If not, head over to the actual game first to get a feel 
for it: http://2048game.com/ 

So this project I coded in my second year Operating Systems course, practicing signals and process synchronization in Linux.

## How To Run
For starters, this will ONLY run in Linux!!!

Download all three executable files: ex2.out, ex2_inp.out, ex2.upd.out. Make sure they are all in the same folder. Then, type
into the terminal `./ex2.out number` where number is a postive integer that is the runtime (in seconds) of the program. So for instance,
`./ex2.out 10` will run for 10 seconds, "./ex2.out 100" will run for 100 seconds.
